The sun dipped behind the old radio tower as a soft hum rolled across the valley. 
Nobody remembered when the tower had been built, but everyone agreed it made the 
night feel a little less empty. A stray newspaper page fluttered across the dirt 
road, carrying half-legible headlines about distant events that nobody here had 
ever seen. The wind paused for a moment, as if waiting for something to happen, 
and then continued on its way—steady, quiet, indifferent.

Under the dim porch light, a rusty tin mug sat forgotten next to a stack of 
unfinished crossword puzzles. A small moth danced around the bulb, tracing 
invisible patterns in the air. Somewhere in the distance, a dog barked once, 
twice, then fell silent again. The world held its breath briefly, then exhaled 
into stillness.

At exactly midnight, the tower’s red beacon blinked three times in slow rhythm, 
as it always did, though no one knew who—or what—set the pattern. But the valley 
accepted it the way it accepted the fog, the stray cats, and the creaking boards 
of the old general store: as part of the strange but comforting tapestry of life.
